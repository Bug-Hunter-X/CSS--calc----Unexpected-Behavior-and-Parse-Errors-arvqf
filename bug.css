The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on CSS values. However, sometimes unexpected behavior can occur due to operator precedence or unit mismatches. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` might result in an unexpected value if the parent element's width is not precisely what you expect.  Another common issue is forgetting spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions, which often leads to unexpected results or parse errors.
